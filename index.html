               	Hello, I'm JG Boucher and my idea is simple, come with your friends, have a good time, drink whatever you want, and watch the spectacle of two men/women who  wants to fight with their fist but also their brain!
               You could participate if you want to, by paying your turn. It is very fun with a friend and you could seduce your crush by showing her/him your skills.
